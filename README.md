At startup, the application requires the user to sequentially enter the paths to the files with the coordinates of the water pipes system, the proposed paths and the file with the results. After that, the program reads the files, parses the lines and writes the data of the first file to the database table. Then the program calculates the possibility of laying the path, coordinates and shorter route length. Finally, the application writes the results to a file. All intermediate actions are displayed in the console. You can use the paths to the test files that are in the root folder.
